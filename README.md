This project implements all required features defined by the [CarOnSale Flutter Callenge](https://gist.github.com/akaTJ/9081fdd1aed3bd8a051ef6de96bf54bf). Please, be mindfull that I am not a UI/UX designer, even though I put some effort into making the UI looks decent.

## App Architecture & Coding Guidelines

For this particular application, I've strived to follow [Flutter's recommended mobile App architecture](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide) as much as possible. There are a few nuances, though, that did not apply for this app. Also, I've following [Effective Dart as coding standard](https://dart.dev/effective-dart).
